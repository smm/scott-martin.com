[Peter Matthiessen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Matthiessen) died this week and I was very interested to learn about his work and writings which includes Zen, Indigenous American rights, and Florida frontier history.

Find linked below some talks by both Matthiessen and others (Joan Halifax, Stephen Batchelor) on the topic of ["Buddhism in America"](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma6/bavol1.html).
